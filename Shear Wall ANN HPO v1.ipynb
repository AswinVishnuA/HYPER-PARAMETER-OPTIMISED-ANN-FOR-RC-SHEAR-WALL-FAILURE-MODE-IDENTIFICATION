Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","[0.52173913 0.44565217 0.46153846]\n","Accuracy:0.4763099219620959\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from keras.models import Sequential, Model\n","from keras.layers import Dense, Input\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier\n","from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n","\n","def ANN(optimizer = 'adam',neurons=64,batch_size=32,epochs=500,activation='relu',patience=3,loss='categorical_crossentropy'):\n","    model = Sequential()\n","    model.add(Dense(neurons, input_shape=(X.shape[1],), activation=activation))\n","    model.add(Dense(neurons, activation=activation))\n","    model.add(Dense(neurons, activation=activation))\n","    model.add(Dense(4,activation='softmax'))  # 10 is the number of classes in the dataset, you can change it based on your dataset\n","    model.compile(optimizer = optimizer, loss=loss,metrics=[\"accuracy\"])\n","    # early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor=\"loss\", patience = patience)# early stop patience\n","    history = model.fit(X, pd.get_dummies(y).values,\n","              batch_size=batch_size,\n","              epochs=epochs,\n","              # callbacks = [early_stopping],\n","              verbose=1) #verbose set to 1 will show the training process\n","    return model\n"],"metadata":{"id":"j8vYCUtVp4aS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# model=ANN()\n","# history=model.fit(X_train,pd.get_dummies(y_train).values,validation_data=(X_test,pd.get_dummies(y_test).values),epochs=100)"],"metadata":{"id":"7-qmldH_rNBU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# model.evaluate(X_test,pd.get_dummies(y_test))"],"metadata":{"id":"2XyXyiwvsHuV"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# print(history.history.keys())\n","# plt.figure()\n","# plt.title('model accuracy')\n","# plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'])\n","# plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'])\n","# plt.ylabel('accuracy')\n","# plt.xlabel('epoch')\n","# plt.legend(['train', 'test'], loc='upper left')\n","# plt.show()\n","# plt.figure()\n","# plt.plot(history.history['loss'])\n","# plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'])\n","# plt.title('model loss')\n","# plt.ylabel('loss')\n","# plt.xlabel('epoch')\n","# plt.legend(['train', 'test'], loc='upper right')\n","# plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"_m1MaCLvssdY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"-d-lX5ZossZ9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","rf_params = {\n","    'optimizer': ['adam','rmsprop','sgd'],\n","    'activation': ['relu','tanh'],\n","    'batch_size': [16,32],\n","    'neurons':[16,32],\n","    'epochs':[20,50],\n","    'patience':[2,5]\n","}\n","clf = KerasClassifier(build_fn=ANN, verbose=0)\n","grid = GridSearchCV(clf, rf_params, cv=3,scoring='accuracy')\n","grid.fit(X, y)\n","print(grid.best_params_)\n","print(\"MSE:\"+ str(grid.best_score_))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hsMukM-f-P4c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645278346787,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1440220,"user":{"displayName":"Aswin Vishnu A","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgvG8vIobv8CTe4BkQ3LjSC-P-Sl2PSAaYvpcwXvg=s64","userId":"01068952504504982261"}},"outputId":"6ea23234-f11d-4dd8-a1a3-1074c8eebafb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 1/20\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:10: DeprecationWarning: KerasClassifier is deprecated, use Sci-Keras (https://github.com/adriangb/scikeras) instead.
